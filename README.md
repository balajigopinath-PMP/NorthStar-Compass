North Star Compass is an interactive decision-support micro-application designed to help product leaders, founders, and teams identify the most appropriate North Star Metric for their product. Rather than relying on intuition or defaulting to vanity metrics, the app guides users through a structured three-question assessment that evaluates how their product creates value, how it captures revenue, and what user success truly looks like.

Based on these inputs, the app classifies the product into one of three strategic value models:

Attention Model – products that win by maximizing user engagement and consumption.

Transaction Model – products that drive value through frictionless, recurring transactions.

Productivity Model – products that deliver efficiency, enabling users to accomplish tasks faster and with less effort.

After determining the most relevant strategic model, North Star Compass presents a clear explanation of the chosen approach along with tailored metric recommendations inspired by industry-leading product examples. These recommendations help teams focus on the single metric that best represents long-term value creation and aligns cross-functional decision-making.

Built using lightweight HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app delivers a modern, responsive experience with smooth transitions, accessible interactions, and optional celebratory visuals. It is intentionally designed to be simple, fast, and intuitive, making it suitable for product strategy workshops, onboarding sessions, and early-stage product discussions.

North Star Compass acts as a practical, repeatable tool for teams seeking clarity in defining the metric that matters most.
